from "Living Documentation: Continuous Knowledge Sharing by Design" by Cyrille Martraire

  Specifying the Type of a Change type must be one of the following:
  - feat: A new feature
  - fix: A bug fix
  - docs: Documentation-only changes
  - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code, such as changes to whitespace, formatting, missing semicolons, and so on
  - refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - perf: A code change that improves performance
  - test: Changes that add missing tests
  - chore: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries, such as documentation generation
